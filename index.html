Plot
Chapter 1 : Radha-Krishna's teenage
Krishna's devotee, Sridama curses Radha-Lakshmi in Goloka to forget Krishna for 100 years and live on Earth. This was a part of cosmic play as it was time for Krishna-Vishnu to make his entry into the mortal world to save Bhudevi from evil. Radha and Krishna are reborn in Barsana and Mathura respectively.[citation needed]
<br>
Krishna is destined to kill his evil maternal uncle, Kamsa. Meanwhile, Ayan, Radha's friend loves Radha and he tries to separate Radha from Krishna. Krishna defeats Vyomasura, a demon whose marriage was fixed with Radha. Krishna removes all humanly weaknesses like bhaya (fear), moha (greed), krodha (anger), ghrina (hatred), irshya (envy), ahankara (pride) and heenbhavna (lack of self-confidence) out of Radha. In the process, she becomes closer to Krishna but is forced to marry Ayan. Later she realises that this marriage is merely an illusion as she can't marry anyone except Krishna because she is the incarnation of Lakshmi and Krishna is none other than Vishnu, Lakshmi's consort. Radha understands that her marriage is fake and eternally, she is Krishna's consort after Brahma completes Brahma Kalyāna (heavenly wedding) of Radha and Krishna in Goloka.
<br>
Krishna, along with Balarama, defeats the demons sent by Kamsa such as Putana, Bakasura, Aghasura, Timirasura, Sudarshana, Arishtasura, Keshi, Vyomasura, Dhenukasura, Ekadansha, Pralambasura, the evil enchanter Sammohana, and his 8 brothers who are defeated by Radha's Ashtalakshmi (8 incarnations of Lakshmi) avatars. Finally, Kans calls Krishna and Balaram to Mathura for killing them. However Balaram kills Kamsa's eight brothers and Krishna kills Kamsa. Krishna's biological parents Devaki and Vasudeva are freed from prison and Kamsa's imprisoned father Ugrasena is crowned king. Now, Krishna, Balarama and the Yadavas move to Dwaraka, their new home. Balarama marries Revati (Jyotishmati) in her earlier life, who loved Balarama as Shesha. Elsewhere, Krishna marries Rukmini. Later, Krishna also marries Satyabhama and Jambavati. He then kills the evil Narakasura and his general Mura.
<br>
Chapter 2 : Mahabharata
The Pandavas have escaped the lac-palace incident which was organised by their evil cousins – the Kauravas, headed by Duryodhana and his brother Dushasana, their uncle Shakuni and Duryodhana's friend Karna. He helps Panchala king Drupada arrange a Swayamvara for his daughter Draupadi, who was born from a yajna. The third Pandava prince Arjuna wins Draupadi's svayamvara and marries her, however circumstances force Draupadi to marry all five Pandavas. The Pandavas receive a new kingdom Indraprastha, faraway from Hastinapura due to the conflict with the Kauravas.

Krishna's sister Subhadra elopes with Arjuna, whereas Krishna kills the Pundra king Paundraka Vasudeva, an impostor. The second Pandava Bhima also kills the Magadha king Jarasan

<p>At the age of 15, he made his dancing debut on a Marathi reality programme, Dance Maharashtra Dance, and was one of the finalists. He also competed in Dance India Dance (Season 4) in 2013, reaching the finals and finishing as the third runner-up.Krishna lives in Vrindavan and Radha in Barsana to experience the love of their past. Following this, Radha completes her life on earth abiding by the curse of Sridama, leaves her mortal body, and returns to Goloka. Gandhari's curse on Krishna comes into effect, and a fight starts within the Yadava clan.
Krishna returns to Dwaraka. Pradyumna returns to Dwaraka and marries Rukmavati, and a son Aniruddha is born to them. To Jambavati and Krishna, a son Samba is born, who is termed to be the reason for the Yadava destruction as cursed by Gandhari. Samba grows up to be short-tempered but loves his family, especially his mother; however, he hates Radha. Later, Samba, Aniruddha, and Balaram's sons Nishath and Ulmuk are sent to Gurukula along with Radha and return after a few years, as teens. Aniruddha is kept in captivity at Shonitapura, the kingdom of Banasura, by his daughter Usha. This soon results in a war between Krishna and Banasura, wherein Shiva has to fight for Banasura due to his boon, resulting in a faceoff between Krishna and Shiva. Krishna defeats Shiva and punishes Banasura for kidnapping his grandson. Soon, Aniruddha is married to Usha while Samba is married to Hastinapur's Kaurava princess, Lakshmanaa, Duryodhana and Bhanumati's daughter. As Samba had previously joined hands with Banasura, he is cursed with leprosy by Krishna and Surya cures Samba. Samba chant and meditate deeply toward Surya using 21 Surya mantram.

Later, Krishna marries Devi Yamuna.

Shankhchuda (rebirth of Sridama) enters the story and has a loving wife, Tulasi, who is his strength but he only uses her. With the help of Tulasi and her devotion to him, Shankhchuda got immense strength and he vows to destroy the whole universe. Krishna disguises himself as Shankhchuda and goes to Tulasi to break her devotion. After Shankhchuda is killed, Tulasi feels cheated. She curses Krishna to become a stone (sālagrāma). However, Tulasi realizes her mistake after she remembers her past. She decides to take her curse back and transforms herself into a Tulasi plant. She then marries Krishna in this form and is told to remain on earth in that form. This displays Tulasi Kalyāna (Tulsi's wedding). Consequently, Hanuman visits Dwarka and witnesses Rama, Lakshmana, and Sita in Krishna, Balarama, and Radha respectively. He gets to know that Krishna and Radha were Rama and Sita in their previous birth and they in turn, are none other than Vishnu and Lakshmi.

Lord Shiva suggests that Krishna should perform the Ashwamedh Yagya, for which he would need someone as his consort (ardhāngini). Krishna chooses Rukmini to sit with him for the yajna; to this his other queens object, claiming that they are equally eligible for sitting with him. Narada advised performing Tulabhara (balancing) in order to find the perfect consort for Krishna. On the weighing scale, Krishna is in one balance and the other queens have to put their jewelry to win Krishna. Rukmini places a pair of bangles gifted by Krishna and a tulasi leaf, and wins him upon balancing the scale.

After Krishna's 100th Janmashtami, the time finally comes, when Sridama's curse comes to an end and Radha remembers everything about Goloka and her true identity as a goddess and the consort of Krishna. Later, she kills Kaptasur, Shalva's accomplice, and Krishna's lookalike, after she realizes his evilness. Afterward, Vidhurath, brother of Dantavakra, tries to kill Radha but gets executed by Krishna's Sudarshana Chakra.

Later, Samba insults Rishi Durvasa in disguise, only to get cursed to be the cause of the Yadava tribe's destruction. Krishna lives in Vrindavan and Radha in Barsana to experience the love of their past. Following this, Radha completes her life on earth abiding by the curse of Sridama, leaves her mortal body, and returns to Goloka. Gandhari's curse on Krishna comes into effect, and a fight starts within the Yadava clan. The entire clan is decimated in the war, Balarama leaves his mortal body and returns to Vaikuntha as Shesha. Post-war, Dwaraka submerges in the Arabian Sea. Later, Jara shoots Krishna's left foot by mistake, resulting in his death. Krishna and Radha reunite in Goloka.
